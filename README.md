# ‚öΩ Football Manager  

## üìå Backend Setup  

```bash
cd football-manager-backend
```

1. Remove `.example` from the `.env` file and update values as needed (frontend URL, ports, DB credentials, etc.).  
2. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   npm i
   ```
3. Run migrations:  
   ```bash
   npx sequelize-cli db:migrate
   ```
4. Run the seeder:  
   ```bash
   npx sequelize-cli db:seed --seed 20250811-demo-data.js
   ```
   **(Running migration and seeder is mandatory)**  
5. Start the backend:  
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

> **Note:** You should also need to set up Redis.

Note: I did a script for load test over the bullmq queue you can run it by write this command (node ./test.js)

üí° Important: Running migrations & seeder is mandatory before starting.
